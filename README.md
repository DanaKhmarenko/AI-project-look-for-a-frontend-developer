# AI-project-look-for-a-frontend-developer
Frontend developer for my project, on a permanent basis is desirable. My project is that I will be developing AI workers based on GPT 4, for sale on marketplaces/for people who have their own business. The frontend developer will be involved in integrating the workers into websites/apps. Occasionally building websites.
Purpose of application: Frontend developer for my project, on a permanent basis preferably.


About the project: My project is that I will develop AI-workers based on GPT 4, for sale on marketplaces/for people who have their own business. AI workers will be developed individually for the customer's specific business. In case of development of AI-workers for marketplaces, its capabilities and goals will be different. 

Uniqueness of the project: At the moment the AI sphere is actively expanding and has a huge potential. Many people are not yet aware of the full capabilities of models like GPT and this is the right time to demonstrate such a product. This project will definitely be justified and demanded. It is also important to mention the universality of the project, as the product will be needed by anyone who has his own business (no matter what kind of business). And, of course, each product will be individually created for a particular business, in accordance with the requirements of the customer.

My part of work: I am engaged in writing file documents intended for employee training, testing, modifications. I do not know anything about programming.

Who I need: The specialist I am looking for will have to deal with the integration of the worker on websites as well as applications. And customizing the worker itself so that it works properly on the site/application.


What we have now: Specifically at the moment, I already have an off-the-shelf AI customer communication manager for my brand that is in the testing and troubleshooting phase. This manager is not being created with the intention of selling, but rather to be a product that future customers of certain AI workers at my place can test. So that they can evaluate the abilities and capabilities of the product I can offer them. 

AI manager's capabilities: 1)navigating the customer through the site; 2)knowing the assortment; 3)communicating in three languages(English, Russian, Ukrainian); 4)providing answers to brand related questions for customers. 5)Assist in writing complaints/feedback, as well as providing step-by-step instructions on how to interact with the site. 6)Ability to search for relevant information that is related to the product/brand from the sources I provided. IMPORTANT: there will be no payment for creating a website for this particular manager (as well as for integrating it into the site, testing, etc.), as this will be created as an example to demonstrate the capabilities of the workers to potential customers.

What I need for the AI manager: For this particular manager, I need to create a separate website to which it will be integrated. The manager will need to communicate with customers, and will also need to have access to the information that is on the site. The site should contain certain sections (where it will be possible to leave a complaint; to see on the map the points of stores in the country with addresses; to see the assortment (prices, descriptions, photos of goods); reviews; a section with links to social networks of the brand; as well as a section for contacting the brand, where you can place a personal order). The manager should have access to the available assortment. The design of the site, as well as its functionality, should be simple and easy to use. I have the color scheme for the site (along with the availability of specific Pantone colors), also there is already a specific font that will be on the site. There will need to be testing of the worker that will be integrated into the site to avoid glitches and malfunctions in the end result.

Workflow: 1) I will be creating the AI worker; knowledge base, necessary documents for its training. 2) The stage in which I will test and finalize the product. 3) You will already be required to integrate the worker into the site or application (it depends on the customer's needs). 4) You will be required to test and troubleshoot the AI worker specifically as it works on the site/app. 5) Upon completion of the project, payment by the customer for the product will take place. 6) The final stage of profit sharing between us.
P.S. I will always be open to communication, work and also to improve the product. There will always be an opportunity to come to a mutual understanding in working together. Mutual respect in communication is a must.

Salary: You, as a partner in the project, will have 50% of the profit of each product (like me).
